#Welcome to my GitHub#

From beginning i was protecting open sourced codes and i am gonna continue protecting it. Simply because when i get confused at some point of my script i was looking at forum, free models and etc..  it wasn't easy to find what i need. So i decided to create repo and share all my knowledge with my scripts so people can learn new things.

##READ Before using it##

Before you started using my scripts please don't forget to make your's script open sourced too so other people can use it.
